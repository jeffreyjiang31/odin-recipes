odin recipes practice

I've learned how to navigate my files and directories a bit using the Linux terminal. I'm also kind of understanding how to commit files and such. It seems that in order to create a directory that I can connect to GitHub, it must be "git cloned git@github.com:jeffreyjiang31/odin-recipes.git".
